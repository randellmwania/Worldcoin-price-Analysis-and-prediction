# Worldcoin Price Prediction

Welcome to the Worldcoin Price Prediction project! üåçüí∞

Predicting cryptocurrency prices is both thrilling and challenging. This project focuses on predicting the prices of Worldcoin using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, making them an exciting field for predictive modeling. In this project, we utilize historical data of Worldcoin prices to train machine learning models for price prediction.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: We start by loading and exploring the historical Worldcoin price data using pandas, gaining insights into the dataset's structure and characteristics.

- **Modeling**: We train several machine learning models, including Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor, to predict Worldcoin prices based on various features such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, volume, and market cap.

- **Evaluation**: We evaluate the performance of each model using the mean squared error (MSE) metric, providing insights into their predictive capabilities.

- **Interactive Prediction**: I provide an interactive interface for users to input new data and obtain predictions for future Worldcoin prices using the trained models.

## Usage

To get started with the Worldcoin Price Prediction project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Explore the Data**: Use Jupyter Notebook or any preferred IDE to explore the historical Worldcoin price data and preprocess it as needed.

4. **Train Models**: Train various machine learning models using the preprocessed data to predict Worldcoin prices.

5. **Evaluate Performance**: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) to determine the best-performing model.

6. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained models to make predictions on new data, enabling users to forecast future Worldcoin prices.
